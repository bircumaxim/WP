On my opinion this laboratory work was easier than previous, I've learned a lot of things starting from how to draw in window using winapi and and finishing with adding bitmap images and place them on the toolbar buttons. Well so I think that this laboratory work proves that WinApi in C++ can be use to make A simple basic paint program as I've done.
